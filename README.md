# OnScreenRuler
An on screen ruler for a Windows Desktop PC user who needs to keep an eye on a line of data whilst looking at something else and back again. One often sees people pointing at the screen with their finger to keep their eye on a value while doing something else with their mouse pointer, perhaps on another screen. The app is simply a ruler that can be dragged to where needed and always stays on top until it is closed from a right-click menu or the Esc key.

It's a work in progress.
## TODO
* Create different rulers; some longer and some different designs.
* Allow the ruler to be rotated and flipped.
* Package and deploy to Windows Store https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-packaging-dot-net
